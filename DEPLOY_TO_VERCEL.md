Vercel deployment guide

This short guide helps you deploy the project to Vercel and obtain a stable production URL you can use for QR codes.

1) Quick web UI deploy (recommended if you use GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket)

- Push your repository to GitHub (or GitLab/Bitbucket).
- Open https://vercel.com and sign up / log in.
- Click "New Project" → "Import Git Repository" → choose your repo.
- Vercel usually auto-detects Next.js. Keep the defaults:
  - Framework: Next.js
  - Build command: `npm run build` (or leave default)
  - Output directory: (leave empty — Next handles it)
- Click "Deploy".
- After deploy completes you get a production domain like `your-project.vercel.app`.

Notes:
- Use the production domain for printing QR codes. Preview URLs change with each commit.
- SSL (https) is automatic on `vercel.app`.

2) Deploy with Vercel CLI (if you prefer terminal)

- Install Vercel CLI globally:
  ```powershell
  npm i -g vercel
  ```
- From project root run:
  ```powershell
  vercel login
  vercel
  ```
  Follow the interactive prompts. The first `vercel` run will create a production deployment after confirmation.

3) Production vs Preview

- Production URL: set during deployment; stable until you change project settings or delete deployment.
- Preview URLs: created on each push/PR — they are temporary and not good for printed QR codes.

4) Limits & billing

- A free `vercel.app` subdomain will not be charged later just because the site is commercial.
- If you exceed free plan resource limits (bandwidth, build minutes, serverless invocation count), Vercel may ask you to upgrade.
- For custom domains you pay the registrar (domain purchase), not Vercel for the `vercel.app` subdomain.

5) After deploy: generate a QR code (quick)

- Use an online QR generator and paste the production URL.
- Or use the included script `scripts/qr-generate.js` (see README instructions below) to create `site-qr.png`.

6) Extra suggestions

- If you want a custom domain, buy it from a registrar or via Vercel UI and attach it to the project.
- To avoid preview URLs being scanned by mistake, print the production domain only.
- Add UTM parameters to the URL if you want tracking from the printed flyer, e.g. `https://your-site.vercel.app/?utm_source=flyer&utm_medium=qr`
